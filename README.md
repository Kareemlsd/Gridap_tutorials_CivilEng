# Gridap Tutorial Series for Civil Engineering Students

## Introduction

This tutorial series introduces **civil engineering students** to the **Gridap** library in Julia. Gridap provides powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method (FEM). The tutorials are designed to build your knowledge progressively, starting with the basics and advancing to real-world applications in civil engineering.

By the end of this series, students will gain hands-on experience with:
- Setting up computational models.
- Solving scalar and vector-valued PDEs.
- Implementing beam and elasticity models for engineering applications.
- Using numerical integration within the Gridap framework.
